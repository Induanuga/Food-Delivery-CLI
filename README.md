# Food Delivery System
## Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Scope
The Food Delivery System is designed to:
- Allow customers to register, log in, view a menu, and place orders.
- Enable customers to choose between home delivery (with automatic assignment of a delivery agent) and takeaway.
- Track the lifecycle of orders (from preparation to completion) with simulated delays.
- Provide a management interface for managers to view all orders and monitor the status of delivery agents.
- Maintain a persistent state using an SQLite database and support operation via a command-line interface (CLI).

### 1.2 Definitions
- **Customer:** End user who places food orders.
- **Manager:** Administrator who oversees system operations.
- **Delivery Agent:** Staff member assigned to deliver orders to customers (not directly interacting with the CLI).
- **Home Delivery:** Orders delivered to the customerâ€™s location.
- **Takeaway:** Orders that the customer picks up.

## 2. System Requirements

### 2.1 Technical Requirements
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Database:** SQLite (database file: `food_delivery.db`)
- **Libraries and Modules:**
  - `sqlite3` for database management.
  - `threading` for simulating order status updates.
  - `datetime` and `time` for handling timestamps and delays.
  - `os` for clearing the screen and interacting with the operating system.
  - `getpass` for secure password input.

### 2.2 Other Requirements
- The system uses threading (with fixed sleep delays) to simulate the order lifecycle.
- Default menu items, a manager account, and a set of delivery agents are automatically created during the initial database setup.

---

### Assumptions
- **Delivery Agent Availability:**  
  If no delivery agents are available for home delivery, the system automatically cancels the order and notifies the customer.

- **Unlimited Item Availability:**  
  The system assumes an infinite stock of menu items, meaning customers can order any item without quantity restrictions.

- **Minimum Order Requirement:**  
  Customers must add at least **one item** to their order before proceeding. The system will prevent order placement if no items are selected.

- **Predefined Users**
  The system comes with hardcoded default users:  
  - Three delivery agents are preloaded into the system.  
  - One manager account is hardcoded into the system.
